Use this template to produce a standard thesis that meets the Oxford University requirements for DPhil submission, and should be passable for other thesis-based degrees (e.g. MPhil) as well. 

% QS: Now updated for the 2024/2025 academic year to ease editing of this thesis class and template for future generations, with a re-inclusion of automatic word counting, to meet the requirements for a Oxford University Department of Materials Part II thesis submission.

In modern LaTeX implementations, you should be able to open Oxford_Thesis.tex with your favorite editor and compile it.  By default, this template uses biber/BibLaTeX for references / citations, so you may have to make the appropriate changes in your build preferences.  A typical 'full build' should be:
1. pdflatex Oxford_Thesis.tex
2. biber Oxford_Thesis
3. pdflatex Oxford_Thesis.tex
4. pdflatex Oxford_Thesis.tex

There should be subfolders called 'Text' and 'Figures'.  Keep all your work in these folders.  This will make your life much simpler when you need to go about deleting and creating files, commenting out sections, and compiling while not accidentally deleting your actual thesis.

Make a new .tex file for each chapter and appendix, and place them in the 'text' folder.  If you'll have a figure-intensive thesis, subfolders in 'Figures' is a good idea.  Use .pdf graphics if at all possible, although the pdfLaTeX compiler also accepts .png, .jpg, .jb2, and .eps graphics formats (with .eps, modern TeX compilers will convert to .pdf).
